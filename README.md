### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://a.humanrightsfirst.dev/ and https://github.com/ShoppingEZ
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning new things and have a passion so far for backend and how complex databases can be!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for help with the design aspect of things!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about where I came from; I haven't been programming my whole life but my story is unique and wonderful just like everyone elses!

- âš¡ In my freetime: I am outdoors and active! Whether it is mowing, playing volleyball, taking a walk on an intermediate trail at the park, throwing football with my son or darts with friends!  I thrive due to having a great work-life balance!
